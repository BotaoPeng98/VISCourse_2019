## Course Learning Outcomes

After taking this course, I hope: 

- Theoretically, Introduce the data (especially spatial data) visualization method. Demonstrate the power of visual analytics in data (especially spatial data) analysis. Select appropriate visualization methods for a given combination of data type and intended analysis task. Assess visual representations according to design and perceptual principles.

- Practically, Use visualization toolkits (e.g., Tableau). Design and implement static and interactive visualizations.
